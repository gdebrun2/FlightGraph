/*
Notes:
All distances in this project are in kilometers

See OpenFlights (https://openflights.org/data.html) for information about the format of its databases

Some airports do not have an OpenFlights ID and are not in airports.dat (see routes.dat line 67503)
Some distinct routes have the same starting and ending airport (e.g. the route is offered by two different airlines) (see routes.dat lines 66149 and 667663)
Some airport names contain a comma
Some airports do not have a code
Some airport routes contain airports that are not stored in the OpenFlights Airports Database (see routes.dat line 30550)

If testing on very large datasets, there may be memory issues since this graph uses an adjacency matrix

FlightGraph has undefined behavior on files that do not follow the OpenFlight format

This graph performs all the insertions/removals during construction
After construction, insertions/removals are not supported

If there is an airport that does not have a known coordinate, its coordinate is set to the South Pole

FlightGraph variables should only be modified by FlightGraph.cpp

For this dataset, |V| < |E| << |V|^2

FlightGraph is designed to run on EWS

Methods may produce undefined behavior if there is more than one connected component or there is a lack of outgoing routes
